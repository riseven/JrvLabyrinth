# JrvLabyrinth

*A labyrinth puzzle game*

A simple openGL based labyrinth puzzle game. The player needs to find the exit
to each level. There are magic circles that when stepped into activate certain things. 
They can open or close doors, trigger elveators, and make appear or disappear other
rings. Some levels are pretty though.
